Specifics

• Create a class queue implemented as a circular array that stores integers. The methods to be
implemented should be called enqueue(x), dequeue(), front(), empty(), and full().
The maximum number of items that need to be stored is 100. This class should contain
only those private data members necessary to implement a normal queue. No additional
methods should be defined in this class.

• Create a derived class of queue called mikeQ. This class should have access to the methods
of the queue class and include two new methods:
– enMike (x) - enqueue the integer x in the normal manner except if it is 10 or greater
than the front of the queue, then insert the value at the front rather than the usual rear.
– deMike (x) - dequeue x items from the front.

• The mikeQ class should contain only the two new methods described above. That
is, this class should not have any additional class variables or methods; all functionality must
be accomplished by calling the methods of the queue class.

• At the bottom of the given main(), add some additional code to display and remove all
remaining items in the queue, one integer per line.
